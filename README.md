# soft-pixel-dungeon
A not-so-hard version of Shattered Pixel Dungeon which is an improved version of Pixel Dungeon

Pixel Dungeon is a great game that everyone should enjoy. Unfortunately permadeath and the randomness make it a very hard game to play. This variation makes it a bit less hard if you so choose.

This adds the ability to save and load games to the sd card.
It also adds a setting to make the game not so hard: useful things dropped in long grass, increased search radius.
